      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I am a second-year student at Belarusian State University, majoring in
        Software for Mobile Devices. I have experience in React development,
        including completing a university course where I solved complex tasks to
        master both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Additionally, I
        created a layout for a small landing page as a freelance project, which
        enhanced my design and client communication skills. Currently, I am
        deepening my expertise in web development and mathematics to strengthen
        my problem-solving abilities and contribute to innovative projects.
